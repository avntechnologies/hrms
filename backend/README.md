# Multi-tenant HRMS backend

A .NET 10 / ASP.NET Core backend for a multi-company HRMS SaaS product. It uses clean project boundaries, controller-service-repository flow, EF Core, PostgreSQL, JWT authentication, tenant query filters, audit history, optimistic concurrency, and soft deletion.

## What is implemented

- SaaS platform: tenant provisioning, trials/subscriptions, employee limits, platform administrator, tenant settings fields.
- Identity: login, refresh-token rotation/revocation, lockout, PBKDF2-SHA512 password hashing, tenant users, roles, permissions, JWT policies.
- Core HR: employees, reporting managers, departments, designations, locations, emergency-contact/document domain models.
- Workforce: shifts, holidays, GPS/IP-aware attendance clock-in/out, work-hour/overtime calculation, timesheets and approvals.
- Leave: configurable leave types, yearly balances, overlap checks, requests, approval/rejection and balance accounting.
- Payroll: period runs, employee payroll items, calculation, approval/payment state machine and totals.
- Talent: openings, candidates, applications/stages, performance cycles/reviews, training courses/enrollments.
- Operations: assets and assignments/returns, expense claims and approval, announcements, employee document verification.
- Employee self-service: profile dashboard, attendance, leave/balances, timesheets, expenses, learning, performance, assets, documents, announcements, payslips and password changes.
- Manager self-service: direct-report directory plus scoped leave, timesheet, expense and performance review workflows.
- Platform concerns: mandatory tenant filters, tenant-scoped unique indexes, pagination, audit logs, outbox table, correlation IDs, RFC 7807 errors, rate limiting, CORS, health endpoint and OpenAPI.

Country-specific payroll tax, statutory filing, bank-payment rails, e-signatures, object-storage upload, email/SMS delivery and SSO/SCIM are integration points, not safe universal defaults. They must be implemented and certified for each target market before claiming legal or payroll compliance.

## Solution layout

```text
src/
  Hrms.Domain/          Entities, enums, domain primitives
  Hrms.Application/     DTOs, ports, business services and workflows
  Hrms.Infrastructure/  EF Core, PostgreSQL, repositories, identity, migrations
  Hrms.Api/             Controllers, middleware and composition root
tests/
  Hrms.Tests/           Isolation, soft-delete and security tests
```

Dependencies point inward: API -> Infrastructure/Application -> Domain. Business services depend on `IRepository<T>` and `IUnitOfWork`; only Infrastructure knows EF Core or PostgreSQL.

## Run locally

Requirements: .NET SDK 10.0.301+ and PostgreSQL 18 (PostgreSQL 15+ is also suitable).

```powershell
dotnet tool restore
dotnet restore Hrms.slnx
dotnet build Hrms.slnx --no-restore
dotnet test tests/Hrms.Tests/Hrms.Tests.csproj --no-build
dotnet run --project src/Hrms.Api/Hrms.Api.csproj
```

The development connection string expects PostgreSQL at `localhost:5432`, database/user/password `hrms` or `postgres` as configured in `src/Hrms.Api/appsettings.json`. Prefer user secrets or environment variables instead of editing committed settings:

```powershell
$env:ConnectionStrings__Hrms='Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=hrms;Username=hrms;Password=your-password'
$env:Jwt__SigningKey='your-64-character-random-signing-key'
$env:Bootstrap__PlatformAdminPassword='your-secure-bootstrap-password'
dotnet run --project src/Hrms.Api/Hrms.Api.csproj
```

Swagger UI is available in Development at `/swagger` and opens automatically through the launch profile. The raw OpenAPI documents are available at `/swagger/v1/swagger.json` and `/openapi/v1.json`; health is `/health`. Use the Swagger **Authorize** button with the JWT access token returned by the login endpoint.

## Docker

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, replace every secret, then run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The API is exposed at `http://localhost:8080`. Production startup refuses an insecure bootstrap password. The initial migration runs automatically when `Database:AutoMigrate` is enabled.

## First login and tenant creation

Log in to the special `platform` tenant with the configured bootstrap administrator:

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tenantSlug": "platform",
  "email": "owner@example.com",
  "password": "your bootstrap password"
}
```

Use the returned bearer token to call `POST /api/v1/platform/tenants`. Tenant provisioning atomically creates the subscription, tenant administrator role/user, and default annual/sick leave types. Log in afterward using the new tenant slug. Authenticated tokens contain `tenant_id`; an optional `X-Tenant-ID` must match it. Refresh calls are anonymous but require `X-Tenant-ID`.

## Employee accounts, roles and attendance

Creating an employee record does not silently create credentials. An authorized administrator should provision the linked account from the employee UI or through `POST /api/v1/identity/employees/{employeeId}/account`. The login email must match the employee work email.

Use the system roles as follows:

| Role | Intended user |
|---|---|
| Employee Self-Service | Individual contributors, including developers |
| People Manager | Employees who manage direct reports; includes self-service |
| HR Administrator | HR staff who administer people and HR processes |
| Payroll Administrator | Payroll staff; does not imply general HR administration |

The application enforces permissions in API policies as well as in the Angular navigation. Employee self-service endpoints require a linked employee ID and scope all records to that employee. Manager endpoints verify that the target employee is a direct report; a tenant ID alone is not sufficient.

Employee clock-in and clock-out calls require browser-provided latitude, longitude and accuracy. The server also records event time, public IP and user agent. These are sensitive personal data: production customers need an explicit privacy notice, jurisdiction-appropriate consent or lawful basis, a retention policy and limited role assignments.

## Main API groups

| Route | Capability |
|---|---|
| `/api/v1/platform/tenants` | Company provisioning and platform tenant search |
| `/api/v1/auth` | Login, refresh rotation and revocation |
| `/api/v1/identity` | Tenant users, roles and permissions |
| `/api/v1/me` | Employee self-service and direct-report manager operations |
| `/api/v1/employees`, `/organization` | Employee directory and organization structure |
| `/api/v1/leave`, `/attendance`, `/workforce` | Leave, attendance, shifts, holidays, timesheets, documents, announcements |
| `/api/v1/payroll` | Payroll calculation and controlled run states |
| `/api/v1/recruitment`, `/performance`, `/training` | Talent lifecycle |
| `/api/v1/assets`, `/expenses` | Employee operations |
| `/api/v1/dashboard`, `/audit-logs` | Tenant metrics and audit trail |

All list endpoints are tenant filtered at the DbContext level. The default page-size cap is 200. Update commands carry `version`; stale updates return a conflict/business-rule response instead of silently overwriting another user's changes.

## Database switching

Domain and Application contain no database provider references. To switch providers:

1. Replace `Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL` in Infrastructure with the new EF Core provider.
2. Replace `UseNpgsql` in `DependencyInjection.cs` and `HrmsDbContextFactory.cs`.
3. Generate a provider-specific migration set; do not reuse PostgreSQL SQL blindly.
4. Run the tenant-isolation and workflow tests against the target engine.

Date-only/time-only and JSON payloads are modeled through EF-supported CLR types and strings to keep the model portable. Index length, collation and identifier casing still require provider testing.

See [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and the [production checklist](docs/PRODUCTION-CHECKLIST.md) before deploying for real customers.
